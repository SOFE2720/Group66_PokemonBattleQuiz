To run the project you must run usbwebserver application. Once the application has launched click on the localhost button and 
it will take you to the home page where there will be a link to the project.

Make sure that mysql and apache are running correctly

If you wish to use wamp place the all the files in the root into the desired location in wamp.

If you come across a runntime error it is due to github's way of downloading the files, in this case we submitted the program to be run through canvas
where the demo is submitted. Please use that file to run project.

Thanks
